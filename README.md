Project title: Where to buy your next home? 

Team members: Sabrina Todd, John (JP) Connolly, Michael Hoffmann
Datasets: Zillow CSV, U.S. Census CSV, NOAA API

Description: 
We will be using public real estate and weather data to build a program that matches prospective home buyers with a list of zip codes / neighborhoods that match their home buying constraints. Specifically, we give users filtering options (such as those listed below) to narrow their search criteria: 

Minimum sale price ($)
Minimum # of bedrooms
Minimum # of bathrooms
Minimum square footage
Proximity to the ocean
Number of days with non-freezing temperature

The program will then analyze the datasets containing home and weather data to output a list of zip codes/neighborhoods that best match the qualities and characteristics identified by the user. As such, the goal of this project is to provide the most optimal match for prospective home buyers and a given location, such that each of their living criteria are met.
