Title: CA Home Finder Application 
Authors: @michaelhoffmann @johnconnolly @sabrinatodd

Description: The objective of this application is to assist prospective home buyers in California 
with their searches for a new home. 

The app asks users to input a series of criteria indicating the preferred attributes of their future residence, 
including: price, number of bedrooms, daily temperature, monthly precipitation, annual days below freezing,  local 
town size, median local age, and local household size. 

After users indicate their preferences, a scoring algorithm ranks all the ZIP codes in California based on their 
compatibility with the inputs. To determine the best matches, this scoring analysis relies on publicly sourced 
housing, weather and population data from the Zillow Housing Data Archive, the NOAA Global Historical Climatology 
Network API, and Californiaâ€™s Department of Finance. The top ZIP code results are then presented to the user, who 
now knows where to look for his or her future home. 

Responsibilities: All team members contributed to the proposal and ultimate design of this project with ongoing 
collaboration across program elements. No individual was restricted to one aspect of the project, however, everyone 
had different focus areas:
	Sabrina: focused on the HomeMatchScorer class to determine how user input was measured against actual data 
		       and building the TestSuite class
	JP:      focused on the retrieving and cleaning the data (WeatherAPI, *Reader classes, DataCompiler) used
		       to be scored against user inputs and building the simple Landing and Output GUI frames
	Michael: focused on building the HousingGUI Class to pass user inputs to the scoring algorithm
